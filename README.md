# Challenges faced :

A small, but interesting responsive landing page coded with just HTML/CSS! This was a challenge that took quite some time, as it was my first time working with a figma file! That made things a lot easier than having to guess the spacings and margins/paddings. I've learned a lot while trying to turn a professional design into code, and it was a lot of fun!

I tried my best to make it as pixel perfect as possible, and I can say I'm very satisfied with the result. There were a few issues with trying to obtain the exact layout, but it turned out to be a real challenge. Nonetheless, google is always our best friend, and I managed to pull through with this amazing piece :D
